Description
MultiCast Routing Problem.

Given a network V = {1,â€¦, N} is the set of nodes, E in VxV is the set of links between nodes. 
A node s in V is the source node which will transmit a package to others nodes. 
A node receiving the package can continue transmit this package to adjacent nodes. 
t(i,j) and c(i,j) are transmission time and transmission cost when transmitting the package from node i to node j. 
Compute the set of links used for broadcasting the package from the source node to all other nodes such that
Total transmission time from s to any node cannot exceed a given value L
Total transmission cost is minimal
Input
Line 1: contains 4 positive integers n,m,s,L (1 <= n, m <= 20, 1 <= L <= 100)
Line i+1 (i = 1, 2, . . ., m): contains 4 integers u,v,t,c in which t and c are respectively the transmision time and the cost associated with the link (u,v) (1 <= t,c <= 100)
Output
Write the total cost of the solution found or write NO_SOLUTION if no solution exists.
